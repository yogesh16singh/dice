#### Syntax

```
EXPIREAT key timestamp [NX | XX | GT | LT]
```


EXPIREAT sets the expiration time of a key as an absolute Unix timestamp (in seconds).
After the expiry time has elapsed, the key will be automatically deleted.

The command returns 1 if the expiry was set or updated, and 0 if the expiration time was not changed. The command supports the following options:

- NX: Set the expiration only if the key does not already have an expiration time.
- XX: Set the expiration only if the key already has an expiration time.
- GT: Set the expiration only if the key already has an expiration time and the new expiration time is greater than the current expiration time.
- LT: Set the expiration only if the key already has an expiration time and the new expiration time is less than the current expiration time.
